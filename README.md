# SpeechRecognition
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

This is a basic project created for AI implementation in Python language.

To decode the speech into text, groups of vectors are matched to one or more phonemesâ€”a fundamental unit of speech. This calculation requires training, since the sound of a phoneme varies from speaker to speaker, and even varies from one utterance to another by the same speaker. A special algorithm is then applied to determine the most likely word (or words) that produce the given sequence of phonemes.

Modules/Libraries that are used are: 
1. pyttsx3
2. speech_recognition
3. datetime
4. wikipedia
5. webbrowser
6. playsound
