# SpeechRecognition
This was a basic project created for AI implementation in Python language.

To decode the speech into text, groups of vectors are matched to one or more phonemesâ€”a fundamental unit of speech. This calculation requires training, since the sound of a phoneme varies from speaker to speaker, and even varies from one utterance to another by the same speaker. A special algorithm is then applied to determine the most likely word (or words) that produce the given sequence of phonemes.
